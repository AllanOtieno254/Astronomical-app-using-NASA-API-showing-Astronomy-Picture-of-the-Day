# Astronomical App using NASA API â€“ Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)


## Project Overview

The Astronomical App using NASA API is a web application that allows users to explore the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) provided by NASA. The app fetches daily space images or videos, along with descriptions and copyright information.

This project is for astronomy enthusiasts, students, educators, and anyone interested in space.

### Key Objectives

- Display NASA's APOD  
- Allow users to select a specific date to view images/videos  
- Provide a random APOD feature  
- Include a download button for images  
- Offer a UI with background space video and a card layout

## Features

### Core Features

- Daily APOD Fetching: Loads the Astronomy Picture of the Day automatically  
- Date Picker: Users can select any date and view the APOD of that day  
- Random APOD: Click a button to view a random space image or video  
- Download Option: Download HD images with one click  
- Responsive Layout: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices  
- Background Video: Space-themed background video  
- UI Card: The information card has a glassmorphic effect  
- Video Support: Supports embedded videos and image content  
- Error Handling: Displays alerts when API requests fail  


## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- UI Frameworks: MDBootstrap, Font Awesome icons  
- Date Picker: Flatpickr  
- API: NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)  
- Hosting: Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify  


## How It Works

1. The app makes a request to the NASA APOD API using an API key  
2. The API responds with JSON containing image/video URL, title, explanation, copyright, and HD URL  
3. The app displays the content in a card layout  
4. Users can pick a specific date, click Random, or view today's APOD  
5. If the APOD is a video, it embeds the video directly; if it's an image, it displays it with a download option
